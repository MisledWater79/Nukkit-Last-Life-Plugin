# Nukkit-Last-Life-Plugin
This is a plugin for Minecraft bedrock edition Nukkit servers that allows it to be played like Hermitcraft's Last Life series.
## Last Life Rules
1. 2+ lives cannot kill/fight others unless they were attacked first.
2. On the beginning of every session the server will **randomly** and **seceretly** select a non-red name to become the Boogeyman
## Boogeyman Info
1. Only non-red life users can be picked as a Boogeyman
2. Only 1 Boogeyman is choosen with a rare chance of 2 Boogeymen
3. If you are the Boogeyman you, by any means necessary, must kill a green or yellow name by direct action to be cured of the curse
4. If the Boogeyman fails, next session they will become a red name
5. All loyalties and friendships are removed while you are the Boogeyman
## Life Info
* At the start of the server everyone will get 2-6 lives
* 5 or 6 lives will have a Dark Green name in chat and above their head
* 4 lives will have a Lime Green name in chat and above their head
* 3 lives will have a Yellow name in chat and above their head
* 2 lives will have a Orange name in chat and above their head
* People with 1 life left will have a Red name in chat and above their head
* Red Names will have all of their friendships and ties broken and become hostile
* Red Names can team up with other red names
* In order to win you must be the last player standing
